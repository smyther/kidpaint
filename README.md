kidpaint
========

Every painting app on the google play store was either crap, or laden with ads.. so I decided to throw something together to remedy this.

It should work in browser on any touch device with an up to date browser (though i've only test it on my Nexus 7 and iPhone 4). It (more than likely) won't work on a desktop, as i've specifically targetted touch events and not mouse events.

It's built in HTML5 and is my first real play with Canvas.

Of course, lots of features could be added, but for now it does the job it was made to do.

The included APK has been complied via the PhoneGap cloud compiler (https://build.phonegap.com/), which is bloody amazing if you can't be bothered to set up the SDK and PhoneGap.

Feel free to fork and add features, or laugh at my dodgy code :)
